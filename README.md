# COE318

Labs completed at Toronto Metropolitan University in the course Software Systems using Java and the NetBeans IDE. The content is my homework so please do not copy but feel free to use it as a reference.

Lab 1 - Outputs the resistance, current, voltage, and power of a created resistor.

Lab 2 - Creates a complex number and does operations on it.

Lab 3 - A counter software

Lab 4 - Two softwares. One that creates a bank account that can withdraw and deposit cash. One that creates banks and adds accounts to each bank.

Lab 5 - Plays a game of blackjack in the console window

Lab 6 - A software that creates resistors and places them between nodes. Then adds those resistors to a circuit and outputs the circuit.

Lab 7 - Similar to lab 6 but allows an input of resistors and voltages betweeen specific nodes and outputs the values in the console.
